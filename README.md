# Python Script Name: Exam_4.py

## Q: What does this script do?
This script takes in a single .txt file where each line only contains a string (e.g., "ATTTGGATT").  The name of the .txt file is specified by the end user as a command line argument. When the program is first executed, the parser will parse out the name of the .txt file containing strings to be analyzed and pass it to Exam_4.py's main() function as an argument.
